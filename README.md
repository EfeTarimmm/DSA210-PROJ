# UnderstandingDepression-DSA210Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to explore the underlying socio-economic and behavioral factors that contribute to depression. By leveraging two diverse datasets, we seek to uncover patterns that highlight how various life circumstances impact mental health. Rather than making direct comparisons between populations, we use different perspectives to strengthen the confidence in our findings and provide a broader understanding of depression risk factors.

The approach is straightforward: analyze large-scale survey data, examine the relationships between economic conditions, social factors, and mental health, and derive meaningful insights to enhance our understanding of depression.

## Objectives

1. **Identify Depression Risk Factors**  
   Investigate the influence of income levels, education, employment status, and social interactions on depression prevalence.

2. **Enhance Insights Through Multiple Perspectives**  
   Utilize datasets from distinct socio-economic backgrounds to reinforce the reliability of findings.

3. **Analyze the Role of Economic and Social Variables**  
   Determine which financial and social conditions contribute most significantly to mental health variations.

4. **Provide Public Health Insights**  
   Leverage findings to support discussions on mental health policies and potential intervention strategies.

## Motivation

This project blends two key areas of interest: mental health research and data science. Here’s why it matters:

- **A Data-Driven Approach to Mental Health**  
  Understanding depression should go beyond subjective assessments. By using real-world data, we can extract meaningful patterns.

- **Real-World Relevance**  
  Identifying the socio-economic factors that influence depression may help inform strategies for addressing mental health disparities.

- **Bridging Different Perspectives**  
  Examining depression through multiple datasets allows us to strengthen our conclusions and ensure they are not context-dependent.

## Dataset

This project relies on survey data capturing a range of demographic, economic, and mental health-related variables.

### **1. NHANES 2017-2020 Mental Health & Demographics Data**
- **Source:** National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
- **Description:** A U.S.-based dataset containing demographic, economic, and mental health screening information.
- **Key Features:**
  - Age, gender, education level, income-to-poverty ratio
  - Depression screening scores (PHQ-9): A nine-item questionnaire assessing depression severity based on self-reported symptoms.
  - Health and lifestyle habits
  - Access to healthcare and social services
- **Scope:** U.S. population, collected through structured interviews and medical assessments.

### **2. Busara Depression Data (Kenya, 2015)**
- **Source:** Busara Center for Behavioral Economics
- **Description:** A dataset focused on economic and social behaviors related to depression in rural Kenya.
- **Key Features:**
  - Household size, income levels, education, and employment status
  - Depression screening results
  - Financial and economic activities
  - Social and community engagement
- **Scope:** Rural Kenyan population, collected via field studies and behavioral surveys.

## Hypotheses

1. **Income and Depression**  
   - **H₀:** There is no significant relationship between income level and depression risk.  
   - **Hₐ:** Lower income levels are associated with a higher likelihood of depression.

2. **Education Level and Mental Health**  
   - **H₀:** Education level does not influence depression prevalence.  
   - **Hₐ:** Higher education levels are correlated with an increased risk of depression.

3. **Social Interaction and Well-Being**  
   - **H₀:** Social engagement does not significantly affect mental health.  
   - **Hₐ:** Individuals with stronger social networks experience lower rates of depression.

## Tools and Technologies

This project utilizes the following tools for analysis and visualization:

- **Python**: For data processing and statistical analysis
- **Pandas**: For data structuring and manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating visual representations (scatter plots, correlation heatmaps, trend analysis)
- **SciPy**: For hypothesis testing and statistical inference

---

## Analysis Plan

1. **Data Processing and Preparation**  
   - Load and clean datasets, handle missing values, and ensure consistency in variable definitions.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
   - Use visualizations to explore patterns and relationships between socio-economic factors and depression rates.  
   - Examples include:
     - Correlation heatmap between economic factors and depression scores
     - Distribution of depression rates across different education levels
     - Income-based depression risk segmentation

3. **Hypothesis Testing**  
   - Perform statistical tests to evaluate the strength of relationships between key variables.
   - Assess whether economic and social conditions are reliable predictors of depression outcomes.

4. **Findings and Insights**  
   - Summarize the key contributors to depression and discuss the potential implications.

---

## Conclusion

By the end of this project, I aim to answer:

- Which socio-economic factors have the strongest influence on depression rates?
- Do findings from different datasets support each other, reinforcing confidence in results?
- How do income levels, education, and social networks interact with mental health outcomes?

This study is not just about understanding depression—it’s about applying data science to uncover insights that can contribute to better-informed mental health discussions and interventions.
